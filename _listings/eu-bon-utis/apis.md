description: 'The EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy is a collection of open source tools
  and services which together cover all aspects of the taxonomic workflow. The workflow
  is grouped into the following areas: taxonomic editing; publishing of edited data;
  data storage and exchange; collections and specimens; descriptions; fieldwork; literature;
  and geography. At the heart of the Cybertaxonomy platform is the Common Data Model
  (CDM), a repository for every conceivable type of data produced by taxonomists in
  the course of their work, and the backend for most EDIT components.'
