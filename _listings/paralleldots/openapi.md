        # Introduction
        What does your API do?

        Text Classification can be useful in understanding customer behaviour by categorizing conversations on social networks, feedback and other web sources.

        # Overview
        Things that the developers should know about

        The API accepts the input parameters as form-data.

        Response will be in JSON as shown below:

        ```
        {
            "usage": "By accessing ParallelDots API or using information generated by ParallelDots API, you are agreeing to be bound by the ParallelDots API Terms of Use: http://www.paralleldots.com/terms-and-conditions",
            "taxonomy": [
                {
                    "tag": "News and Politics",
                    "confidence_score": 0.576461
                },
                {
                    "tag": "Religion & Spirituality",
                    "confidence_score": 0.473842
                },
                {
                    "tag": "Hobbies & Interests",
                    "confidence_score": 0.318032
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        # Authentication
        What is the preferred way of using the API?

        An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


        # Rate limit
        Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

        There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.
